# Order Management System

A TypeScript-based order management system for exchange trading that handles order flow with time-based trading windows, rate limiting, and queue management.

## Overview

This system receives orders from upstream systems and manages their transmission to an exchange based on configurable trading hours and rate limits. It provides sophisticated queue management with support for order modifications and cancellations, along with comprehensive response tracking and latency metrics.

## Features

- **Time-based Trading Windows**: Configurable trading hours with automatic logon/logout
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttling mechanism to control orders per second to exchange
- **Queue Management**: Smart queuing with support for modify and cancel operations
- **Response Tracking**: Complete order lifecycle tracking with latency metrics
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent order processing with thread-safe operations
- **Persistent Logging**: Order metrics and response logging for analysis

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Threading Model

- **Single-threaded Exchange Communication**: Since `send*` methods are not thread-safe, all exchange communication is serialized through a dedicated thread
- **Async Processing**: Uses Node.js event loop and async/await for non-blocking operations
- **Queue Processing**: Dedicated timer-based queue processor for rate limiting

### Rate Limiting Strategy

- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Maintains available order slots per second
- **Precise Timing**: Sub-second precision using `setInterval` and timestamp tracking
- **Queue Overflow Handling**: Orders exceeding rate limits are queued for next available slot

### Queue Management

- **In-Memory Queue**: FIFO queue with order modification support
- **Modify Operations**: Updates price/quantity of existing queued orders
- **Cancel Operations**: Removes orders from queue before transmission
- **Order Matching**: Uses orderId for queue operations

### Time Window Management

- **Timezone Support**: Configurable timezone for trading hours
- **Automatic Session Management**: Handles logon/logout based on trading window
- **Order Rejection**: Rejects orders outside trading hours

## Configuration

The system uses `config/trading-config.json` for configuration:

```json
{
  "tradingHours": {
    "start": "10:00", // Trading start time (HH:MM)
    "end": "15:30", // Trading end time (HH:MM)
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata" // Timezone for trading hours
  },
  "rateLimit": {
    "ordersPerSecond": 100 // Maximum orders per second
  },
  "credentials": {
    "username": "trader_001",
    "password": "secure_password_123"
  }
}
```

## Key Assumptions Made

1. **RequestType Detection**: Added `requestType` field to `OrderRequest` interface for detecting New/Modify/Cancel operations
2. **Timestamp Tracking**: Added timestamp fields for latency calculation
3. **Order ID Uniqueness**: Assumes orderIds are unique across all upstream systems
4. **Configuration Format**: Uses JSON configuration files for settings
5. **Storage Mechanism**: Uses file-based logging for metrics storage (no external database)
6. **Timezone Handling**: Uses JavaScript Date and timezone strings for time management
7. **Recovery**: No persistence of queue state across system restarts
8. **Error Handling**: Orders failing validation are logged and rejected
9. **Memory Management**: In-memory queue with no size limits (assumes reasonable order volumes)
10. **Network Reliability**: Assumes reliable connection to exchange (no retry logic)

## Installation & Setup

## Detailed Implementation Documentation

### ConfigManager (`src/config-manager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Centralized configuration management with validation and error handling.

**Design Decisions**:

1. **Singleton Pattern Avoided**: Chose instance-based approach for better testability and flexibility
2. **Eager Validation**: Configuration is validated immediately upon loading to fail fast
3. **Path Flexibility**: Configurable config file path with sensible defaults
4. **Strong Typing**: Leverages TypeScript interfaces for compile-time safety
5. **Comprehensive Validation**: Validates structure, data types, and business rules

**Key Methods**:

- `loadConfig()`: Loads and validates configuration from JSON file
- `getConfig()`: Returns validated configuration (throws if not loaded)
- `validateConfig()`: Private method ensuring configuration integrity
- Getter methods: `getTradingHours()`, `getRateLimit()`, `getCredentials()`

**Validation Rules**:

- Time format validation using regex (`HH:MM` format)
- Positive number validation for `ordersPerSecond`
- Required field validation for all configuration sections
- File existence and JSON parsing validation

**Error Handling Strategy**:

- Descriptive error messages for debugging
- Fail-fast approach - invalid config prevents system startup
- Wraps underlying errors with context

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:

- **Environment Variables**: Rejected due to complexity of nested configuration
- **YAML Format**: Rejected to avoid external dependencies
- **Hot Reloading**: Deferred to future improvements for simplicity

### TimeManager (`src/time-manager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Manages trading window state, timezone conversions, and session management.

**Design Decisions**:

1. **Dependency Injection**: Takes ConfigManager as constructor parameter for loose coupling
2. **Session State Tracking**: Maintains internal state for logon/logout status
3. **Timezone Abstraction**: Provides simplified timezone conversion without external dependencies
4. **Event-Driven Design**: Returns actionable state information (shouldLogon/shouldLogout)
5. **Overnight Trading Support**: Handles trading windows that cross midnight

**Key Methods**:

- `isWithinTradingHours()`: Core business logic for trading window validation
- `getTradingSessionState()`: Returns comprehensive session state with action flags
- `setLoggedIn()`: Updates internal session state after logon/logout operations
- `isTradingActive()`: Convenience method combining session and time validation
- `getNextTradingEvent()`: Provides timing information for scheduling operations

**Timezone Handling Strategy**:

- **Simplified Implementation**: Basic timezone conversion for common zones
- **Production Note**: Documents need for proper timezone library in production
- **Supported Timezones**: IST, EST, GMT, UTC with extensible design
- **DST Limitation**: Acknowledges Daylight Saving Time limitations

**Session Management**:

- **State Separation**: Distinguishes between "within hours" and "logged in"
- **Action Flags**: Provides shouldLogon/shouldLogout for decision making
- **Atomic Updates**: Single method to update login state consistently

**Overnight Trading Consideration**:

- **Cross-Midnight Support**: Handles trading windows spanning midnight
- **Time Comparison Logic**: Robust comparison for same-day vs overnight windows
- **Edge Case Handling**: Proper handling of 24:00 and 00:00 transitions

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:

- **External Timezone Library**: Rejected to maintain no-dependency requirement
- **Cron-like Scheduling**: Rejected for simplicity - polling approach chosen
- **Event Emitter Pattern**: Deferred - current synchronous approach sufficient
- **UTC-Only Storage**: Rejected - timezone conversion needed for business logic

### RateLimiter (`src/rate-limiter.ts`)

**Purpose**: Core business logic for order queue management, rate limiting, and order modifications.

**Design Decisions**:

1. **Callback-Based Architecture**: Uses dependency injection for send operations to maintain separation of concerns
2. **Sub-Second Precision**: 100ms polling interval for precise rate limiting control
3. **FIFO Queue with Modifications**: Maintains order sequence while allowing in-place modifications
4. **Stateful Rate Limiting**: Tracks orders per second with automatic reset on second boundaries
5. **Comprehensive Queue Operations**: Full support for New/Modify/Cancel operations per requirements

**Key Methods**:

- `processOrder()`: Main entry point for all order operations with routing logic
- `handleQueueOperations()`: Processes Modify/Cancel operations on queued orders
- `processQueue()`: Background processor for sending queued orders within rate limits
- `getQueueStats()`: Monitoring interface for queue state and rate limit status

**Rate Limiting Strategy**:

- **Token Bucket Variant**: Maintains count of orders sent in current second
- **Automatic Reset**: Counter resets on second boundaries for continuous operation
- **Immediate vs Queued**: Direct sending when under limit, queuing when at capacity
- **Precise Timing**: 100ms processor interval for sub-second responsiveness

**Queue Management Design**:

- **In-Memory FIFO**: Simple array-based queue for order sequencing
- **Modify Operations**: In-place price/quantity updates without position change
- **Cancel Operations**: Immediate removal from queue regardless of position
- **Order Preservation**: Maintains original timestamp for latency calculation

**Thread Safety Considerations**:

- **Single-Threaded Model**: Relies on Node.js event loop for atomic operations
- **Callback Pattern**: Ensures send operations are serialized through single callback
- **Timer-Based Processing**: SetInterval provides consistent, non-blocking queue processing

**Memory Management**:

- **Bounded Queue**: No artificial queue size limits (assumes reasonable order volumes)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Orders removed after sending, no memory leaks
- **Shallow Copying**: Efficient object manipulation without deep cloning overhead

**Monitoring & Observability**:

- **Queue Statistics**: Real-time metrics for queue length and rate limit status
- **Order Tracking**: Methods to check order presence and queue position
- **Emergency Controls**: Queue clearing capability for exceptional situations

**Performance Optimizations**:

- **Array Operations**: Efficient splice/push operations for queue management
- **Direct Indexing**: FindIndex for O(n) order lookup (acceptable for expected volumes)
- **Minimal Object Creation**: Reuses existing objects where possible

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:

- **Priority Queue**: Rejected - FIFO requirement from business logic
- **Database Persistence**: Rejected - in-memory sufficient for requirements
- **Worker Threads**: Rejected - Node.js event loop sufficient for volume expectations
- **Async/Await for Queue**: Rejected - callback pattern simpler for current use case
- **Queue Size Limits**: Deferred - no business requirement specified

### MetricsLogger (`src/metrics-logger.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive order lifecycle tracking, latency measurement, and persistent metrics storage.

**Design Decisions**:

1. **Map-Based Tracking**: Uses Map for O(1) order lookup and timestamp tracking
2. **File-Based Persistence**: CSV format for easy analysis without external database dependencies
3. **Multiple Log Streams**: Separate files for metrics, responses, unmatched responses, and abandoned orders
4. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Automatic cleanup of old pending orders with configurable timeout
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of logging failures without affecting core operations

**Key Methods**:

- `recordOrderSent()`: Tracks outgoing orders with timestamps for latency calculation
- `recordOrderResponse()`: Processes exchange responses and calculates round-trip latency
- `getTrackingStats()`: Provides real-time monitoring of pending orders and system health
- `cleanupOldOrders()`: Prevents memory leaks by removing abandoned order tracking

**Persistence Strategy**:

- **CSV Format**: Human-readable, analyzable with standard tools (Excel, SQL imports)
- **Multiple Files**: Segregated data types for different analysis purposes
- **Atomic Writes**: Uses appendFileSync for consistency (trade-off for simplicity)
- **Header Management**: Automatic header creation for new log files

**Latency Calculation**:

- **High Precision**: Millisecond-level timestamp tracking using Date.now()
- **Round-Trip Measurement**: From order send to response receipt

- **order-responses.log**: Detailed response information with human-readable types
- **unmatched-responses.log**: Responses for orders not in tracking system
- **abandoned-orders.log**: Orders that exceeded timeout without response

**Memory Management**:

- **Bounded Tracking**: Map size controlled by response processing and cleanup
- **Configurable Cleanup**: Default 5-minute timeout for abandoned orders
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Minimal memory overhead per tracked order
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents indefinite memory growth

**Performance Considerations**:

- **Synchronous I/O**: Trade-off for simplicity - acceptable for expected volumes
- **Map Operations**: O(1) lookup/insert/delete for order tracking
- **Minimal Object Creation**: Reuses timestamps and avoids unnecessary allocations
- **Batch Processing**: Future enhancement opportunity for high-volume scenarios

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:

- **Database Storage**: Rejected to maintain no-external-dependency requirement
- **Asynchronous Logging**: Deferred for simplicity - synchronous sufficient for current needs
- **Binary Format**: Rejected in favor of human-readable CSV for debugging
- **In-Memory Only**: Rejected - persistence required for analysis and audit
- **Single Log File**: Rejected - separate files provide better organization and analysis
